# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to learn lower level components of establishing a sound web service architecture using Blockchain. 
In this project, I created a DAPP food delivery supply chain solution on Ethereum using smart contracts to track and verify a order authenticity.

## Project Workflow
1. Consumers register on the platform
2. Consumers will browse through the food items and make an order.
3. Consumers will make payment for their order.
4. Restaurants will confirm order and payments.
5. Restaurant will process order.
6. Restaurant will package order and give it to the dispatch rider.
6. Dispatch rider will confirm order and deliver to the consumer.
7. Consumer will confirm receiving order.


## UML Diagrams
I created UML activity, sequence, and state diagrams to showcase the development plan for the project.
